### :hatching_chick: Hello! My name is Jackson and I am an MPA Student at Columbia University School of Inernational and Public Affairs :globe_with_meridians:. My concentration is International Security Policy. One of my interests is to better understand how information operations unfold and spread, and so I hope developing my python skills will allow me to become a better policy researcher in that area. I have previously worked at the Federal Trade Commission and as a Math teacher at a high school in Micronesia. In my free time I read a lot, both fiction and about world history and culture, and I like to write short stories.
